  "body": "### How to create my own font\r\nIf you wish to create font with your own artworks - you can use [fontello](http://fontello.com) to simplify process.The only thing you need to do - prepare images in SVG format. Fontello currently support 2 vector formats:\r\n\r\n1. SVG fonts.\r\n\r\n1. SVG images.\r\n\r\nUsually, other vector formats can be converted to SVG. But we will use only SVG images in this session.\r\n\r\n### Importing SVG images\r\nYou should understand that font formats do not support all of the features that the SVG format provides. Though we try to automate the import process, sometimes it's necessary to make adjustments to artwork in order to achieve the desired result.\r\n\r\nHere are our recommendations:\r\n\r\n1. Remove all fills and colors. You can probably leave black fills.\r\n\r\n1. Convert text layers into path.\r\n\r\n### The remaining process is really simple.\r\n\r\n1. Import your SVG images.\r\n\r\n1. Select them (you can select multiple images by mouse click + drag).\r\n\r\n1. Go to second tab and update CSS names if needed.\r\n\r\n1. In the third tab, update glyph codes if needed.\r\n\r\n1. Set font name on the left from download button.\r\n\r\n1. Go to Settings > Advanced menu and fill development info.\r\n\r\n1. Download your font.\r\n\r\n### Importing converted icon fonts into your HTML.\r\n1. Use this converted icon fonts into your HTML with `@font-face`(like you do with the custom fonts).\r\n\r\n### Things to remember.\r\n1. Always try to convert all SVG icon at one time and always use proper name of svg icon file, just because in case of design changes you have to add some new icon in you icon-font file.\r\n\r\n1. Avoid using custom font name (other then the svg file name).\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n\r\n1. Fonts are vectors, so there is no pixelation or blurring on high-resolution screens as there would be if the graphic was raster and needed to scale up.\r\n\r\n1. The browser support is as good as you need it to be\r\n\r\n1. Once the system is in place, using them is very convenient.\r\n* Arguably easier than spriting images.\r\n* They can be controlled with CSS, like the size, color, shadow, etc.\r\n",
