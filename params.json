  "body": "### How to create my own font\r\nIf you wish to create font with your own artworks - you can use [fontello](http://fontello.com)to simplify process.The only thing you need to do - prepare images in SVG format. Fontello currently support 2 vector formats:\r\n\r\n1. SVG fonts.\r\n\r\n2. SVG images.\r\n\r\nUsually, other vector formats can be converted to SVG. But we will use only SVG images in this session.\r\n\r\n### Importing SVG images\r\nYou should understand that font formats do not support all of the features that the SVG format provides. Though we try to automate the import process, sometimes it's necessary to make adjustments to artwork in order to achieve the desired result.\r\n\r\nHere are our recommendations:\r\n\r\n1. Remove all fills and colors. You can probably leave black fills. In fonts, fill is defined by contour direction. Make sure that you don't have any complex rules like evenodd fills.\r\n\r\n2. Convert text layers into path.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.",
